# fmLib - A Multi-Framework Utility Library

fmLib is a versatile library designed to streamline your scripting experience by consolidating various frameworks, resources, and utilities into a single, cohesive package. The goal of fmLib is to provide a convenient wrapper that simplifies the integration of commonly used tools and functionalities. fmLib also provides a set of modules that can be used to enhance your scripts.

## Overview

fmLib is an WiP (Work in Progress) project developed for personal use, containing a collection of modules and wrappers that the author finds valuable for creating scripts in FiveM. While it may not encompass every possible resource or framework, it aims to cover a broad spectrum of commonly used tools, making it a valuable asset for developers.

## Features

- **Framework Wrappers:** fmLib wraps various frameworks, providing a unified interface for easier access and manipulation.

- **Modules:** fmLib includes a set of modules that can be used to enhance your scripts. These modules are designed to be as lightweight as possible, and can be used independently of the framework wrappers.
